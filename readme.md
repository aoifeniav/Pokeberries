Hi! This is my first project working with APIs.

This web app is a Pokémon berry catalogue that gets data from PokéAPI: https://pokeapi.co/

Top (left) panel shows the berries list, from which you can click on a berry to show its details on the bottom (right) panel.

When a berry is displayed, you can press a button to feed it to Snorlax.

Depending on the berry flavors values, Snorlax can react in different ways.

Currently, the app supports three different reactions:
- "Love it!", when sweet flavor value is the highest.
- "Burns!", when spicy flavor value is the highest.
- "Yummy!", in any other case.
